# The WindRose Project
Custom Hardware , Firmware and Software for Robotic Cellular Automata Experiments.

### We’re used to hearing about evolution by competition, but what about thinking about things that evolve from cooperation?
<p>We can learn a lot about ourselves by simulating robotic beings communicating, sharing information, tools and interacting as a community of living beings. In these simulations, questions emerge such as the importance of synchronicity between beings, the need for a shared language for mutual understanding, among many other issues. That’s what this project and research is about.</p>

She is the one who made this project possible and inspired us by her research on Robotic Plants and Complexity Theories.</p>
